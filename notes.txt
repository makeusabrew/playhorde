Horde
-----
Top down Kadoom style game but with hordes of zombies trying to get you.
They wouldn't be very smart but there would be lots of them. Levels start
off pretty quiet, users can do... stuff... (pick up weapons?).

Each level is essentially just a fenced in rectangle with varying amounts
of gaps in the fence. Zombies can only come through gaps in fences. Over time,
more gaps appear in the fencing letting more zombies in at once. User can repair
gaps sometimes if they have repair toolkits in hand.

Ammo etc is limited but killing zombies will randomly drop stuff - ammo, guns,
grenades, mines, repair kits.

Maybe instead of repair kits, users get fence panels? That's a bit weird actually.
But it would be nice to be able to create new fences, somehow.

Maybe there are other things like trees which you can chop down.

Should be able to set things like automatic turrets, traps, etc.

What about making stuff a bit more line-of-sight ish?
